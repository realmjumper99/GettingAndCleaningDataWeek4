# GettingAndCleaningDataWeek4
Project for Cleaning Data  Course on Coursera

The file "run_analysis.R" is broken in to 3 sections
'1' - makes a table containing the test set with only the mean and standard deviations
'2' - makes a table containing the training set with only the mean and standard deviations
'3' - combines the 2 tables into a bigger table then makes the dat atidy using melt and dcast
It then ouputs a tidydata text file which has also been uploaded

# Project Description
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
